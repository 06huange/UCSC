Minimum Weight Spanning Tree Solver

The program takes a weighted undirected graph as input and uses Kruskal's
algorithm to find the mwst for the graph and outputs it to the output file.

Union by Rank is used to check if a cycle exists in the graph.

Note: Union by Rank code snippets were borrowed from the "Kruskal's Algorithm" page on Geeksforgeeks
as well as qsort().
