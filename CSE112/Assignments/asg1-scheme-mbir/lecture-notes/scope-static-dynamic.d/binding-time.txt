Binding time:  static or dynamic.

Static:

1. language definition time (reference manual)

2. language implementation time (writing the compiler/interpreter)

3. translation time (from C/C++/Ocaml to object file)

4. link time (combining object files into executable binary)

Dynamic:

5. execution (loading program into CPU as a process)
   maybe using a dynamic link library

6. initialization before main function is called

7. binding addresses or values by any function
